# Web Programming – Course Summary

This repository contains all the lab work for the **Web Programming** course. Each project explores key concepts in frontend and backend development using standard web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**, with database integration and dynamic content handling.

## Course Overview

The course was structured to progressively develop full-stack web skills:

### 1. HTML & CSS Fundamentals  
- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML  
- Styling layouts using CSS: positioning, responsive design, media queries  
- Building clean, mobile-friendly UI components

### 2. JavaScript & DOM Manipulation  
- Handling user events (`click`, `input`, etc.)  
- Form validation with JavaScript  
- Dynamic DOM updates based on user interactions

### 3. Client-Side Logic & AJAX  
- Making asynchronous requests using `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch()`  
- Loading and updating data without page refresh  
- Implementing **live search** and **dynamic tables** using JavaScript + AJAX

### 4. Backend Programming with PHP  
- Writing server-side logic to process requests and interact with the database  
- Connecting to a **MySQL database** using `mysqli`  
- Handling CRUD operations from the frontend to the backend (Lab 6)  
- Using PHP to generate HTML content dynamically

### 5. Full Integration: Frontend ↔ Backend  
- Using AJAX to send requests to PHP endpoints  
- Processing JSON and dynamically updating the frontend  
- Structuring code for maintainability across HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP

## Skills Gained
